h2. About amq-client

amq-client is a fully-featured, low-level AMQP 0.9.1 client that runs on Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2, REE, Rubinius and JRuby.
It's sweet spot is in serving as foundation for higher-level, more opinionated AMQP libraries.
It can be used directly by applications code when performance and access to
advanced AMQP protocol features is more important that API convenience.

h2(#amqp_gems_family). How does amq-client relate to amqp gem, amq-protocol and libraries like bunny?

 * At the lowest level, "amq-protocol gem":http://github.com/ruby-amqp/amq-protocol takes care of encoding, decoding and framing.
 * One level above is "amq-client gem":http://github.com/ruby-amqp/amq-client that takes care of network I/O, provides uniform interface for
various I/O libraries like "EventMachine":http://rubyeventmachine.com/, "cool.io":http://coolio.github.com/ or good old TCP sockets and implements
AMQP protocol entities (queues, exchanges, channels and so on) with emphasis on access to every feature available over API convenience or
conciseness.
 * Finally, end applications use libraries like "amqp gem":http://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp or "bunny AMQP client":http://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny


h2. Adapters

Currently implemented adapters:

 * "EventMachine":http://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine
 * "cool.io":http://coolio.github.com/

h3. EventMachine adapter

At this point EventMachine adapter is feature-complete, well-tested, supports 5 Ruby implementations
(1.8.7, 1.9.2, JRuby, Rubinius, Ruby Enterprise Edition) plus Microsoft Windows(tm) and
is used by amqp gem starting with version 0.8.0.


h3. cool.io adapter

cool.io adapter is on par with EventMachine but is not used by any popular libraries (that we know of).
Note that cool.io doesn't work on JRuby and Microsoft Windows(tm).

h3. TCP socket adapter

TCP socket adapter is work in progress right now. It will be useful for synchronous libraries such as Bunny.
We plan to implement Bunny 1.0 on top of this adapter. See "#12":https://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny/issues/12.

h2. Installation

amq-client is available from rubygems.org:
