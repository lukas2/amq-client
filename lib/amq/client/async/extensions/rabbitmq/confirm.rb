          # h2. Purpose
          # In case that the broker crashes, some messages can get lost.
          # Thanks to this extension, broker sends Basic.Ack when the message
          # is processed by the broker. In case of persistent messages, it must
          # be written to disk or ack'd on all the queues it was delivered to.
          # However it doesn't have to be necessarily 1:1, because the broker
          # can send Basic.Ack with multi flag to acknowledge multiple messages.
          #
          # So it provides clients a lightweight way of keeping track of which
          # messages have been processed by the broker and which would need
          # re-publishing in case of broker shutdown or network failure.
          #
          # Transactions are solving the same problem, but they are very slow:
          # confirmations are more than 100 times faster.
          #
          # h2. Workflow
          # * Client asks broker to confirm messages on given channel (Confirm.Select).
          # * Broker sends back Confirm.Select-Ok, unless we sent Confirm.Select with nowait=true.
          # * After each published message, the client receives Basic.Ack from the broker.
          # * If something bad happens inside the broker, it sends Basic.Nack.
          #
          # h2. Gotchas
          # Note that we don't keep track of messages awaiting confirmation.
          # It'd add a huge overhead and it's impossible to come up with one-suits-all solution.
          # If you want to create such module, you'll probably want to redefine Channel#after_publish,
          # so it will put messages into a queue and then handlers for Basic.Ack and Basic.Nack.
          # This is the reason why we pass every argument from Exchange#publish to Channel#after_publish.
          # You should not forget though, that both of these methods can have multi flag!
          #
          # Transactional channel cannot be put into confirm mode and a confirm
          # mode channel cannot be made transactional.
          #
          # If the connection between the publisher and broker drops with outstanding
          # confirms, it does not necessarily mean that the messages were lost, so
          # republishing may result in duplicate messages.
